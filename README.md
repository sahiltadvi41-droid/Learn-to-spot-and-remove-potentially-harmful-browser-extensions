how malicious extensions can harm users?
Malicious browser extensions can severely harm users by stealing sensitive data, installing malware, hijacking user sessions, and disrupting browsing activity. They can compromise personal information like passwords, credit card details, and browsing history, leading to identity theft or financial loss. Additionally, these extensions can be used to distribute other malware or act as a backdoor for attackers to access a user's system. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Data Theft:
Malicious extensions can monitor browsing activity, capture login credentials, and steal cookies, potentially leading to account takeovers and financial fraud. 
Malware Installation:
They can install other malware or spyware, which can silently monitor user activity, exfiltrate data, or even control the user's device. 
Session Hijacking:
By stealing session cookies, attackers can impersonate users on websites, gaining unauthorized access to accounts and potentially causing significant damage. 
Browser Manipulation:
Malicious extensions can alter browser settings, inject malicious scripts into webpages, and redirect users to unwanted websites. 
Reduced System Performance:
Some malicious extensions can consume excessive resources, slowing down the browser and the overall system. 
Privacy Violations:
They can track user behavior, collect personal data without consent, and violate user privacy. 
Supply Chain Attacks:
Attackers can compromise legitimate extensions and use them to distribute malicious updates, affecting a large number of users. 
Undetected Malicious Activity:
Malicious extensions can be designed to avoid detection by using obfuscation techniques or activating only under specific conditions.
